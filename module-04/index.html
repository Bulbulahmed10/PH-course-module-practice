          <h4>Les Arcs La Plagne, France</h4>
          <img
            src="https://planetofhotels.com/guide/sites/default/files/styles/paragraph__text_with_image___twi_image/public/2021-12/Les-Arcs-La-Plagne-1.jpeg"

          <article>
            TThe famous ski resort of Les Arcs is located in the heart of the
            French Alps, in the Haute-Tarentaise valley. Together with
            Peisey-Vallandry and La Plagne, it forms a single ski area called
            Paradiski. Les Arcs La Plagne includes four mountain stations, named
            after the altitude and having a common network of elevators — Arcs
            Pierre Blanche (1600 m), Arcs-1800, Arcs-1950, and Arcs-2000. The
            resort also includes the town of Bourg-Saint-Maurice, which lies at
            the foot of the mountain. The ski resort offers 425 kilometers of
            trails of varying difficulty levels, located at an altitude of 1200
            to 3225 m. Skiing here will please both beginners and experienced
            skiers. The beginners usually choose the Arc-1800 zone, and the
            professionals greatly appreciate the Launched Kilometer speedway on
            the slope of the Aiguille Rouge. Each level has at least one
            downhill lit up at night. Les Arcs offers plenty of activity options
            for non-skiers as well. The Arc-1800 area has a snowpark with
            shapes, halfpipe, and border-cross trails. Several slopes are
            suitable for freeride skiing. Launched Kilometer trail can be used
            for ziplining. Dog sledding is available in the Arc 2000 area.
            Chambéry Airport is 127 km from Les Arcs, 145 km from Lyon, and 156
            km from Geneva. Travel can be by shuttle, cab, or by bus. There are
            direct trains from Paris, Lille, Amsterdam, Brussels, and London to
            Bourg-Saint-Maurice, which is 15 km from Les Arcs.

            Disneyland Resort in Anaheim is the realization of Walt Disney's
            dream of the perfect vacation park, a magical world of cartoons and
            fairy tales where wonders await at every turn. When it opened on
            July 17, 1955, the "king of animation" could answer precisely the
            many letters from children asking where the characters from their
            favorite stories lived. Mickey Mouse, Minnie, Snow White, the
            gnomes, Peter Pan, and Winnie the Pooh all settled in Disneyland. At
            the time of its opening, Disneyland Resort consisted of just one
            theme park, which, over time, has evolved into a grand resort
            complex. Now, on 200 hectares of land, there are two theme parks
            (Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure), the Downtown
            Disney shopping complex with a 12-screen movie theater, three
            hotels, a lot of stores and restaurants.

            Römerberg is Frankfurt am Main's main square and the busiest
            pedestrian area. It represents the center of the old city - the
            Altstadt. The town hall has been located in the Römer complex,
            consisting of eleven buildings, since 1405. In front of it, you can
            see the Fountain of Justice (Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen), built in
            Renaissance style in 1543, and opposite stands the Old Church of St.
            Nicholas (Alte Nikolaikirche). Römerberg square is surrounded by old
            half-timbered houses, many of which contain restaurants, bars, and
            stores. In winter, a traditional Christmas market is held here.

            British airline EasyJet and charity foundation Aerobility are
            launching flights allowing one to admire the unique natural
            phenomenon — northern lights at an altitude of over 9,000 meters.
            These organizations already have cooperation experience. Eight years
            before the Covid-19 pandemic, hundreds of passengers had an
            opportunity to enjoy the magnificent sight from the sky. Some have
            also used it for romantic purposes — in February 2020, an
            Oxfordshire couple in love got engaged during the flight. The trip
            includes lunch at the Sofitel London Gatwick Hotel, a pre-flight
            briefing, informational accompaniment by northern lights experts
            from the British Antarctic Survey, and drinks and entertainment on
            board. The flight will depart from London's Gatwick Airport.
            Tourists will go to 61 degrees north latitude in search of a
            spectacular spectacle. You can book tickets for the flight on
            Aerobility's official website. Discounts are available for
            passengers with disabilities, their companions, and children under
            16. Meals during the trip are included in the price. The proceeds
            from ticket sales will go to support people with disabilities.

            The Royal Palace is the official residence of the Norwegian rulers.
            It is located on Bellevue Hill at the end of Karl Johans Street. Its
            construction began in 1824 and lasted until 1849. King Harald V and
            Queen Sonja reside in Det kongelige slott. Here they hold audiences
            and dinner parties, receive foreign heads of state, and convene the
            Council of State. In summer, the Royal Palace is open to the public.

          <article>
            anlaon is the highest mountain in the Visayas and one of the most
            beautiful active stratovolcanoes in the country. Only trained
            mountaineers can climb to the top and see the impressive
            crescent-shaped crater. The ascent along the steep mountain paths
            can take up to three days. But the difficulty of the route is
            compensated for by its scenic beauty. You have to walk through dense
            jungle, past waterfalls, hot springs, and caves. There are many
            pyroclastic cones and extinct craters on the mountain's slopes. The
            fact that Canlaon is an active volcano adds to the thrill for
            trekkers. But hikers are not allowed to approach the active Lugud
            Crater, which has been smoky since 2015. They go up to the base camp
            at the top, which offers a circular panorama of the Visayas

            Mount Apo is the highest mountain in the Philippines. It is located
            between North Cotabato and Davao and is the highest point on the
            island of Mindanao. Conquering the "foremother" of all Philippine
            mountains, as it is called here, is not easy, even for experienced
            climbers. Daredevils, who challenge and reach the summit, have a
            fascinating, yet daunting journey. The braves pass through dense
            jungle, mossy forests, green meadows, and mossy bogs, overcome a
            stormy river, and conquer sheer cliffs. They can see Mount Apo's
            four famous lakes along the way — boiling mud-filled Agco,
            crystal-clear Venado, turquoise Macadac, and Jordan. But the
            ultimate reward awaits at the top. Mount Apo rises 2,956 meters. Its
            summit offers an amazing view of almost the entire island of
            Mindanao, its majestic mountain ranges, and the endless sea. You
            will not find such stunning scenery anywhere else in the
            Philippines.
